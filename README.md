## User Registration

### Context

User registration systems are screens, forms, or profile pages that request information from a user to create a web-based account or profile. A user registration system generally asks a user to create a username, password, contact and other information.​

Most of the web applications have user registration form to record enough user information to facilitate user authentication.​ The user can change his profile information later at any time when it is required.​

This is Application created using TypeScript, where we are using `fetch` API to `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` to intract with the JSON data.
